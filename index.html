	<h1>The Floridita</h1>
    <img src="images/jesus.jpg" alt="My test image">
	<p>In May, my girlfriend and I visited Cuba to celebrate her birthday. Visiting <a href="https://www.pbs.org/hemingwayadventure/floridita.html">The Floridita</a> was a highlight of our trip. Grabbing a cold, refreshing daiquiri was the perfect way to cool down after being out under the sun all day. 
Ernest Hemingway frequented the bar while living in Havana in the 1930’s. The legend says that this is when and where the daiquiri was invented. It was Hemingway’s favorite drink. In fact people say he once drank 17 daiquiris in one sitting! Three was my limit, our guy Jesus was not shy with the rum! Today, a statue of Hemingway is seated at the end of the bar in his favorite seat.</p>
